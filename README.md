# Easy Flask/Python Heroku Setup

## Instant Flask/Python kit ready to be deployed


> RPDP is a content management system that manages Residential Life past/present programs, staff communication, and peer feedback. Every program event put on by Residential Advisors will be placed on a calendar to allow other RA's to see whats going on in other residential communities. Also these programs will be archived with details about the event and feedback from residents and staff. The goal of this project is to provide easy communication between Residential Life staff, build programming community, and prevent RA's from making programming mistakes learned from other events.
